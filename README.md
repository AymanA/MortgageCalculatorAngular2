# Angular 2 Mortgage Calculator

This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the [Angular 2 Mortgage Calculator](https://github.com/JozefJarosciak/MortgageCalculatorAngular2).

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.
I recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
